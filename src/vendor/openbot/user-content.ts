// CopilotKit/OpenBot shared/user-content.ts; see LICENSE and UPSTREAM.md.
/**
 * What a person said, in the shape a chat model reads. Read by both Bots.
 *
 * A message is a string until somebody attaches a file. Then the composer sends a list of parts —
 * what the person typed, then the file — and `copilot.ts` resolves each file before the run leaves
 * the server: a text file becomes a text part carrying its contents, an image an `image` part
 * carrying its bytes. Both Bots read `content` with `String()`, which for that list is
 * `[object Object],[object Object]`, so that is what the model was sent in place of the question and
 * the file both.
 *
 * ONE DECLARATION FOR BOTH BOTS, for the reason `bot-prompt.ts` gives for `NO_ANSWER_CAME`. The two
 * shapes returned are the ones OpenAI's chat completions take, and LangChain's OpenAI, Anthropic and
 * Google converters read the same two blocks, so one answer serves `agent-bot` and `agent-langgraph`
 * alike and the two cannot drift.
 *
 * A part neither shape can carry is NAMED, not dropped, which is the rule `resultText` in
 * `server/src/plugins/mcp.ts` follows for a tool result: a model told "[audio]" can say something was
 * attached that it cannot hear, and a model handed nothing answers as though nothing was attached.
